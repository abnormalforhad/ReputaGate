# ReputaGate: The FairScale Reputation Portal

ReputaGate is a production-ready Solana application that leverages **FairScale** reputation infrastructure to reward high-integrity users with premium DeFi yields and exclusive access.

## 🛡️ FairScale Integration
ReputaGate integrates the FairScale API to verify wallet reputation in real-time. This data is used to:
- **Gate Access**: Only wallets with a "Silver" tier or higher can access the platform.
- **Scale Rewards**: APR bonuses are dynamically calculated based on the `fairscore` (e.g., Platinum users get +10% APR).
- **Social Proof**: Displays badges (Diamond Hands, LST Maxi) directly in the user profile.
